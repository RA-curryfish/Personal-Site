            <h3>Nutanix (Jan '22 - June 22')</h3>
            <p>I interned here for five months in the Networking team. I helped migrate 
              their cloud regressions from Jenkins to their own test automation software. This allowed for dynamic 
              deployment of resources to run the tests on, which saves time and skips the tedious process of bringing it up manually. 
              I also changed around 400 test case configurations to make sure they are able to run on the company's test automation software.

          <h3>Bachelor Thesis (Aug '21 - Dec '21)</h3>
          <p>I undertook a thesis project on the topic "Analysing the Interactions of People and Events on Social Media Platforms" at BITS Hyderabad.
            This aimed to study the similartiy and differences in the way that people interact and respond to issues depending on the platform,
            source of the post, or the events that unfold. Comments from Facebook and YouTube were chosen as data, and a couple of news media channels
            were chosen that reported a particular issue.

            <h3>Microsoft (May '21 - July '21)</h3>
            <p>I interned here for two months in the Enterprise Commerce team. I helped build a developer's playground of UI components using Storybook.
              This contained documentation, code, controls, parameters and accessibility compliance of the components. Developers could change the parameters
              of the components, see how it renders and behaves, and then decide to implement it in their production code. I also created the unit and snapshot tests
              to check if the components behaved as expected.
